# vue-crypto-coin-watcher

> this is a simple Vue project to watch cryptos

> This is a super simple example using Vue.js. It was created as a 'sandbox' to help with retention as I started learning Vue. (My first Vue code) At the moment, it polls an API to update information for the products you have selected in the drop-down. It incorporates Vuex (for the store), an event bus, modules, axios, moment, some global and scoped styles. Nothing fancy. Just a sandbox.
